[This translation is a work in progress.]

Welcome to the Dream of Comic Club!

We provide club classes at 19:00 on Tuesdays where a professional teacher comes to teach us drawing skills! We also hold a club gathering at 19:00 on Thursdays, where everyone can come to relax and chat about stuff with friends!

<!-- TODO: the tag isn't yet translated -->

Each semester we have a *bunko display*, where members are invited to showcase one's collection! We also hold a [*singing festival*](/tags/歌謠祭) after midterm exams, where everyone sings anime insert songs, VOCALOID, UTAU, Vtuber songs, etc., if you're interested please join us!

(Recent activities aren't quite up to date currently, please forgive me ><)
