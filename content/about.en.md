title: About the Dream of Comic Club
---

We are the Dream of Comic Club! We are based in the First Campus of NKUST. Anyone with a love for anime culture (called *ACGN* in Taiwan) [are welcome to join us](/en/join)!

# Regular activities

We provide club classes at 19:00 on Tuesdays where a professional teacher comes to teach us drawing skills! Everyone has different levels of drawing skills, but anyone interested can still participate!

We also hold a club gathering at 19:00 on Thursdays, where everyone can come to relax and chat about stuff with friends! No matter if you're here to grind rhythm games, read your favorite manga, or draw illustrations, you're all welcome! Our hope is that regular gatherings can help foster closer ties between club members!

Club activities are all on pause during the week of exams and one week before that, so everyone can focus on studying.

# Common activities

Our club also hold some activities every semester. For example, the *bunko display* lets everyone showcase their collection, and the [*singing festival*](/tags/歌謠祭) lets everyone sing their favorite songs, in a kind of informal karaoke-style.

# Membership fees

Regarding membership fees: members can see the income and expenses for each semester. Rest assured we only spend membership fees responsibly! For each member, we ask for 500 TWD total, which can be split into 250 TWD per semester for two semesters.
