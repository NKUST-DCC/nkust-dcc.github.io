If you want to join the club, tell a committee member about it. After filling out the joining form and paying the membership fee, you'll now be a member of the club!

It's recommended to join our LINE group for new students first, where we'll provide information regarding the time and place for club classes and club gatherings. You're also welcome to come to our *early-semester welcome party* (期初茶會/新生茶會) first.

The LINE group for new students closes around November.

*Note that practically speaking, as far as I can tell, there are currently no English speakers in the club, so amenities may not be as ready as they should be.*

Generally club classes are held at **K309**, while club gatherings might change location more often. Please refer to the information we provide in the LINE group instead.

If you then decide to join the club, either tell a committee member about it, or you can also do so during the early-semester welcome party. After the membership fee is paid, you will be offered to join the main LINE group for members, as well as get the *members* role in our Discord server.

The membership fee is 500 TWD total, which can be paid once or split into two semesters, 250 TWD each.

Member perks:

- Join the main LINE group for members
- The *members* role in [our Discord](https://discord.gg/Jfwmjeu8qa)
- Using club resources in the club office

We welcome anyone who's interested in anime culture!
